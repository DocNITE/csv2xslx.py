# What is this?
Small script for importing `.csv` data from AIDA64 reports to `.xslx` table.

# How to use?
put script file into folder, where placed `.csv` files, and run
`py csv2xslx.py <bundled_excel_file>`

Also it required: `pandas, openpyxl`

# suscsv2xslx.py 
Works also original script, but used for convert `.csv(converted)` from that [site](https://products.aspose.app/cells/conversion/htm-to-csv) to `.xlsx` file.
